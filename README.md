# Java Starter Project
This will create a Gradle build driven Java project to quickly create a new Spring powered Java 
Web Application. The front-end is powered using webjars by AngularJS. The main CSS framework is
Pure CSS. 

Feel free to modify the project to suit your needs.

# What to update?


In the `build.gradle` file you will find the project and deployable anmes, make sure you update those.

* Update or remote the `HelloWorld.java` controller for this application. 
* Update the `basePackages` under `ViewConfiguration` to match the actual packages of your application
* Update the `modules` under `/src/main/resources/public`, these are the items that drive the front-end
