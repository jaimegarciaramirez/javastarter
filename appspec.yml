# AppSpec Configuration for AWS Code Deploy
os: linux 

# We need to copy our artifacts over to the tomcat applications directory
# This can be replaced with an environment variable reference defined in the 
# AWS instance - for example $TOMCAT_DIR
files:
  - source: javastarter.war
    destination: /home/ubuntu/applications/apache-tomcat-7.0.62/webapps
    
# Before the application is deployed, Tomcat needs to be stopped and 
# the existing applications cleaned up, otherwise, AWS Codedeploy will not
# overwrite the files. 
hooks:
 ApplicationStop:
   - location: cleanup-tomcat.sh
 # Now we can start up Tomcat once again
 ApplicationStart:
   - location: start-tomcat.sh
